## Install

Clone this repo and execute the following command in your favorite shell:

* `npm install` or short `npm i`

## Play

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app:

* `npm start` will build the application and start a local server using webpack-dev-server to watch, re-build (in-memory) and reload the app on each change.

* `npm run build` or `npm run build:prod` can be used to prepare a distribution bundle.

Finally, open a browser and navigate to `localhost:9000`.

Have fun!
